# HellTaker-Bot
I hated the final boss of the HellTaker DLC (ExamTaker), so I made a bot to destroy it but I ended up making a bot for the whole game.<br><br>
## ‚ö†Ô∏è If anyone from the game development team feels offended by this bot, I can remove it.

# Use

1. Open Helltaker in windowed mode and open the bot. <br>
2. Start a new game or select a chapter. <br>
3. At the beginning of the level press the corresponding button and the player will move automatically.<br>

  - üìå **Notice** <br>
    - The bot only solves the puzzles and defeats the bosses, the narrative screens must be played manually <br>(The screen when picking up the Forbiden Lore piece is passed automatically)<br>
    - The Judegement or the final boss of Examtaker can be played completely automatically or just one of the stages in case you don't want so much help.
